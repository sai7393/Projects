;any variable 'x' here is actually (ax + c)
;each line their corresponding variations with constants added etc will also work

polyonomials :
addition, subtraction of polynomials


trigonometric:
sin(x)
cos (x)
tan (x)
cot (x)
sec(x)
cosec(x)
sec^2 (x)
cosec^2 (x)
1/ sqrt( 1 - x^2 )
1/ sqrt ( -1 - (- x^2))
1/ ( 1 + x^2)
-1 / (1 + x^2)
  
asin (x)
acos (x)
 
 exp:
 
 
 log :
 
 
by parts ( specifically , normal byparts and things of the form f(x) * f'(x))
divide ( f'(x) / f(x))  

will poly division in single degree work, because
