Q.1) The hashtag we chose for this question is: #brandbowl. The Topsy API was used to obtain the top five tweets. The 'limit' field in the code was set to '5'. The tweets are stored as a list in ret['response']['results']['list'].
The 'top_tweets.txt' file contains each tweet item in the list in a single line.

The tweet text, user posting the tweet and the posting date of the top five tweets is as follows:

1. Text: "#brandbowl http://t.co/QoiFznuBKF", User: "darth", Posting date: 1422837061
